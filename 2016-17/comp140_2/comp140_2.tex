``Bad programming is easy. [People] can learn it in 21 days, even if they are dummies...[Good programming requires a] willingness to devote a large portion of one's life to deliberative practice...So go ahead, buy that book; you'll probably get some use out of it. But you won't change your life or your real expertise as a programmer in 21 days...How about working hard to continually improve over 24 months? Well, now you're starting to get somewhere...''

In this assignment, you are required to design and implement a component for a game. The component must be based on one or more existing third-party APIs: for example web services, hardware device SDKs, open-source libraries, or open dataset formats. Your prototype should function as an add-on to either one of the games being developed by students on the BA Digital Games course; or the game that you developed in COMP150. Whichever option you choose, you may implement your component in C++, C\#, Python, or a combination of these. 

Application programming interfaces (API) allow programmers access to a vast array of third-party services and data-sources from social networks to real-time sensor networks. They are the conduits for communication between applications. Most software projects will involve API integration of some kind and so the focus of this assignment is to help you familiarise yourself with the concepts and techniques needed to integrate third-party services into your own projects.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a proposal for a game component that will:
        	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{state and justify} the game that will be the basis for your comonent;
    		\item \textbf{outline} the initial concept in detail;
		\item \textbf{show} the key user stories, in the form of a Trello task board;
		\item and \textbf{list} the key requirements the component must fulfil;
		\item including which technologies (implementation languages, APIs, etc.) you will use.  
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement} a draft version of your your game component :
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{improve} upon the design over the course of two weeks;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement} the final version of your game component that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} the design based on feedback from your peers;
	\end{enumerate}
     \item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of the game controller to your tutor that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{show} your programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}    

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{pair programming task}. Fork the GitHub repository at:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-api-hacking }

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Python}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Design is feasible, distinctive and has creative merit.
\end{enumerate}

To complete part A, write your proposal in the \texttt{readme.md} document. Show this to your tutor in-class. If acceptable, this will be signed-off.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough progress is made to conduct a meaningful review each week;
\end{enumerate}

You will build your prototype component over \textbf{three weeks}. You should aim to have a `potentially shippable' component at the end of each week; that is, a component which does not have any major flaws or half-finished features that prevent it from being tested. For the first two weeks, the component should be working either within the game or in a separate testing environment; for the final week, the component should be fully integrated into the game. Ensure that any digital artefacts (including but not limited to design sketches, photographs, art assets, source code, electronic circuit designs) are pushed to GitHub prior to each weekly session. Also ensure that you bring your prototype with you each week. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} and \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

To complete Part C, bring an executable of the game, with your component integrated, to the demo session in class. Be prepared to discuss it with tutors and peers. 

This part is not assessed, but you will receive feedback which will be useful to you on future projects.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Participate in the demo session.

\subsection*{Part D}
To complete part D, create a zip file containing the following: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item A markdown file named readme.md containing your proposal from part A, and any other documentation you feel is appropriate (e.g. special instructions for testing the component). 
	\item Screenshots of your Trello task board to evidence your project management. and screenshots documenting any checklists or other information within your cards.
	\item All source code created for part B. You do not need to provide the entire source code for the game. Any code which was not written by you must be clearly identified as such, in the readme.md file and/or as comments in the code files themselves. 
	\item A Windows executable version of the game with your component integrated. Or, in the case of a mod for a commercial game, an executable version of the mod with clear installation instructions. Do not include copyright material which you do not have permission to redistribute. 
\end{enumerate}
	
The recommended way to produce this zip file is to check all of the above into your GitHub repository throughout the course of the project, and then use the ?Download Zip? function on the GitHub website. Any material you do not wish to upload to GitHub (e.g. the executable) must be added to the zip file manually before uploading. 

Upload your zip file to the appropriate submission queue on LearningSpace. Note that LearningSpace accepts only a single zip file per submission, with a maximum file size of 1GB. If the game executable is larger than this, contact your tutors to make alternative arrangements.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of the game component. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Creating new software solutions from scratch is an important skill for software developers. However it can lead to ?reinventing the wheel?: spending much time and effort solving problems which have already been solved by others. Thus an equally important skill is being able to bring together existing code from different sources to produce a cohesive whole. Ensure that your choice of technologies is appropriate. Read up on the alternatives to determine which is the best fit for your proposed component. 

Falmouth University is nationally and internationally renowned as an arts institution. Despite the fact that you are studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in a technical discipline, you are still expected to strive for the same level of innovation and creative flair as your fellow students in other departments. All assignments on this course involve a mix of technical and creative activities; cultivating both of these skills in tandem will stand you in good stead for a career in the games industry. One approach to promoting creativity is divergent thinking: generation of ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Often the most interesting ideas are subversive: they deliberately go against the conventional or most obvious solution. 

The first step in planning your implementation should be to break your proposed component down into user stories. Your user stories should be distinguishable (i.e. there should be little overlap between them) and easily measured (i.e. it should be easy to tell when each user story has been implemented). They should also be comprehensive, i.e. the user stories should completely capture the desired functionality of the component, with no gaps. Your code will be assessed on functional coherence: how well the finished component corresponds to the user stories, and whether there are any obvious bugs. Correspondence to user stories runs both ways: implementing features that were not present in the design (?feature creep?) is just as bad as neglecting to implement features. 

Your code will also be assessed on sophistication. To succeed on a project of this size and complexity, you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, library features, and object oriented programming concepts. Appropriateness to the task at hand is key, however: you will not receive credit for shoehorning a complicated solution into your program where a simpler one would have sufficed. 

Maintainability is important in all programming projects, but doubly so when working in a team. Use comments liberally to improve comprehension of your code, and choose carefully the names for your files, classes, functions and variables. For high marks you should use a well-established commenting convention for high-level documentation of your files, classes and functions. The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions. Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent formatting style: indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc. Hard-coded literals (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided, with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
