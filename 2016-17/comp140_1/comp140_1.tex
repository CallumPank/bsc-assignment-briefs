In this assignment, you will work as an individual, to design and prototype a novel game controller. Your prototype should function as an input device for either one of the games being developed by students on the BA Digital Games course; or the game you developed in COMP150 last semester. Your prototype should use a hardware platform such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi etc, to convert user actions into game inputs. 

Computing for games embraces the core values of the hacker movement.  Experimentation, ingenuity and creativity are at the heart of everything we do. Custom game controllers are the perfect place to flex your creative flare and problem solving skills, whilst gaining invaluable experience working with hardware. 

This assignment is formed of several components:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write}, a proposal for a novel game controller that:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{assesses} the game controller market;
    		\item \textbf{states} which game is the basis for your interface;
    		\item \textbf{justifies} your choice of game;
		\item \textbf{outlines} your design in detail;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, three physical prototypes which:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{improves} the design over each iteration;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{implement}, a final physical prototype which:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
		\item \textbf{revises} the design based on the results of a heuristic analysis.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present} a practical demo of the game controller to your tutor that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{demonstrate} your \textbf{individual} programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

Fork the GitHub repository at:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-hardware }

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Python}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item research is thorough;
	\item concept is appropriate and distinctive;
	\item approach is considered and justified.
\end{enumerate}

To complete part A, on GitHub, edit the \textbf{readme.md} file to contain a description of your proposed game controller. Your proposal should include details of any background research you have done to assess commercial viability. On Trello, create a task board that defines the key requirements (in terms of components and user stories) of the controller. 

\textbf{Formative submission:} Arrange a meeting with your tutor to discuss your concept and task board. 

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative assessment}. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

You will build \textbf{three prototypes} over a period of \textbf{3 weeks} utilising a fast, iterative development process. Each week should see a vast improvement in the quality of design and development working towards a shippable product to demo in the fourth week. that is, a prototype which does not have any major flaws or half-finished features that prevent it from being tested, and that can be used (even if lacking some features) as a controller in the game. 

Use the forked repository to store any digital artefacts (including but not limited to design sketches, photographs, art assets, source code, electronic circuit designs). 

To complete Part B, prepare your game controller for heuristic analysis. It must be fully functional and robust enough for testing. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled peer-review session. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, revise the build and source code for your game controller based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload all project files to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.
\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative} submission. This work is individual and will be assessed on a threshold basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion; 
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge and communication skills; 
	\item No breaches of academic integrity. 
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of the game controller. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your tutor.

\section*{Additional Guidance}
Falmouth University is nationally and internationally renowned as an arts institution. Despite the fact that you are studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in a technical discipline, you are still expected to strive for the same level of innovation and creative flair as your fellow students in other departments. All assignments on this course involve a mix of technical and creative activities; this assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far. On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve higher than a C grade overall, as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept ? bear this in mind when working on your design. One approach to promoting creativity is divergent thinking: generation of ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Often the most interesting ideas are subversive: they deliberately go against the accepted or most obvious solution 

The history of video games is littered with failed peripherals which consumers simply did not want, which were perceived as expensive gimmicks rather than legitimate enhancements to gameplay. Your creativity should be balanced by commercial awareness: your design should be informed by your research into products that have succeeded and failed in the past, and what underexploited niches exist in the present. An A? project would be a highly divergent idea, but one that has clear commercial viability. Do not be too discouraged if you fall short of this: this is a tall order even for the professionals! 

We have given you some of the materials you need: an Arduino and other useful components. You will need to add your own materials to produce a functional physical prototype. A ?Blue Peter? style prototype made from household items is fine, as is something made out of modeling clay, construction toys etc. However you should still choose your materials carefully, as overly flimsy construction may lose you marks on the functionality criterion. 

You may also wish to connect electronic components such as LEDs, buzzers, photoresistors etc to the Arduino, or even use a different, more flexible hard- ware platform such as RaspberryPi. However you are discouraged from spending large sums of money on extra hardware, and doing so is not required to achieve a high mark. If you choose to go down this route, it is possible to purchase a RaspberryPi and other useful peripheral online for around the price of a textbook (up to \pounds40). 

You should aim to demonstrate a high level of sophistication in the technical execution of your prototype. An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job: if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it. The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one?s own cleverness, is a dangerous habit for a software developer. 
The sole purpose of the video demonstration is to aid moderators and external examiners, who are not present for the demo session, in assessing your work. Your video does not need to be entertaining or highly polished: a smartphone or webcam video of you or someone else using the controller is sufficient.
