In this assignment, you will work in pairs to design and prototype a novel game controller. Your prototype should function as an input device for either one of the games being developed by students on the BA Digital Games course; or the game you developed in COMP130 last semester. Your prototype should use a hardware platform such as Arduino or Raspberry Pi etc, to convert user actions into game inputs. 

Computing for games embraces the core values of the hacker movement.  Experimentation, ingenuity and creativity are at the heart of everything we do. Custom game controllers are the perfect place to flex your creative flare and problem solving skills, whilst gaining invaluable experience working with hardware. 

This assignment is formed of several components:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write}, a game controller proposal:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describe} the game you have chosen as a basis for your interface;
    		\item \textbf{justify} your choice of gamethe requirements implied by the contract;
		\item \textbf{outline} your concept;
		\item \textbf{identify} potential issues that you may encounter;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{implement}, an \textbf{iterative}, design and development process:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{push} changes to \textbf{GitHub} on a regular basis;
    		\item \textbf{evidence} substantial progress on a \textbf{week-by-week} basis;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Evaluate}, the work of and receive \textbf{feedback} from your \texfbf{peers}:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{implement} heuristic analysis;
		\item \textbf{discuss} your work;
		\item \textbf{receive} and \textbf{reflect} on feedback from peers. 
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a practical demo of the game controller to your tutor that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{demonstrate} your academic integrity;
    		\item as well as \textbf{demonstrate} your \textbf{individual} programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is a \textbf{pair programming task}. Fork the GitHub repository at:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-hardware }

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{Python}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item research is thorough;
	\item concept is appropriate and distinctive;
	\item approach is considered and justified.
\end{enumerate}

To complete part A, on GitHub, edit the \textbf{readme.md} file to contain a description of your proposed game controller. Your proposal should include details of any background research you have done to assess commercial viability. On Trello, create a task board that defines the key requirements (in terms of components and user stories) of the controller. 

\textbf{Formative submission:} Arrange a meeting with your tutor to discuss your concept and task board. 

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough work is available to conduct a meaningful review;
	\item A broadly appropriate review of a peer's work is submitted.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare draft versions of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled peer-review session. Then, attend the scheduled peer-review session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{collaborative} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, revise the computer program based on the feedback you have received. Then, upload it to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.  The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion;
	\item Clear evidence of programming knowledge \textbf{and} communication skills;
	\item No breaches of academic integrity.
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part D, prepare a practical demonstration of the computer programs. Ensure that the source code and related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session.

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

It is critically important that you do not neglect your individual roles in the development process. Programming in pairs means that you work together on the same computer---switching between driver and navigator. It is a great opportunity to develop your technical communication skills and overcome common misconceptions about programming. It should not, however, be treated as a 'free ride'---you will get to review each others' progress. 

You are being expected to \textit{transform} and \textit{repurpose} encodings (i.e. manipulating existing pictures). However, you may create your own images if desired. When using images you have not authored yourself, the source should be noted in the GitHub README.md file. 

You can and should go beyond the techniques introduced in the lectures and the Guzdial book (e.g. researching algorithms for producing or manipulating graphics). The solutions must be written in Python, and any Python frameworksmay be used. So, for example, Kivy, Pillow, PyGame, and JES submissions are acceptable.

You are not being assessed on speed or memory performance. Do not worry too much about framerate, etc.

A common pitfall is poor planning or time management. Often, students underestimate how much work is involved in first learning programming concepts and then actually applying them. Programming is quite unlike other subjects in that it cannot be crammed into a last minute deluge just before a deadline. It is, therefore, very important that you begin work early and sustain a consistent pace: little and often.

The first deadline is quite close to the start of the course and not much material will have been covered by this point. Please rest assured. This first formative submission is supposed to be a simple analysis of requirements. We expect there to be errors. However, it is very important to make a start on this project so you recieve early feedback to give you some direction and to encourage you to practice your programming skills across the entire duration of the course. Ideally, you should be programming every day!

The peer-review component of this work does sometimes raise alarm. However, the only way to learn how to review code is by reviewing code. Your tutor will guide you through the process and provide advice. With practice, it will become clear what is satisfactory by discussing the quality of work with your peers and your tutor during the peer review sessions.
