    The \emph{Arduino} is an open-source prototyping platform that makes designing and developing interfaces fun \& easy.}
\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to \textbf{choose} an existing \textbf{screen-based} game interface to \textbf{evaluate} with a focus on usability and user-experience. Although the choice of game interface is down to you, careful consideration must be given to select an interface that is complex and interesting enough to warrant interrogation. 

User-centred design (UCD) puts the end user at the heart of the design process with a focus on usability and user-experience (UX). Evaluation and testing is a pivotal to human-centred design and should be incorporated into every stage of a projects development. There are vast array of tools and techniques for evaluating your designs, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. It is vital that you are able to identify the correct approach for any given situation and apply the right tools and techniques effectively to iteratively improve your designs in order to build better solutions for the end user. 

This assignment is formed of \textbf{one} part.
The summative submission has \textbf{one} part: a single digital portfolio. 

Begin by forking the GitHub project at the following URL:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp140-hardware}
\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write} a 200-word proposal \textbf{with} references which must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{state} a specific research question which you intend to address;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the way in which you intend to address the question;
    		\item and then \textbf{list} at least \textbf{6} appropriate academic references to use to support your research.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a 15-minute summary of your research that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} each persons final research question;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the key findings of your research;
    		\item and \textbf{discuss how} these findings apply to working practice.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft 1000-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{describes} the agile philosophy \textbf{and} agile principles associated with the research question;
    		\item and \textbf{addresses} the research queston.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} a final 1000-word essay which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp150-agile}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 



\subsection*{A. User Journey Map}

On GitHub, create a Markdown file (or edit \texttt{readme.md})
defining the high concept of your controller.
Include details of any background research you have done to assess commercial viability.

On Trello, create a task board that defines the key requirements
(in terms of components and user stories) of the controller.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Arrange a meeting with your tutor to discuss your concept and task board.

\subsection*{B. Heuristic Evaluation}

You will build your prototype controller over a period of \textbf{4 weeks} utilising a \textbf{fast}, \textbf{iterative} development process.
Each week should see a vast \textbf{improvement} in the quality of design and development working towards a \textbf{shippable product} to demo in the fourth week. that is, a prototype which does not have any major flaws or half-finished features that prevent it from being tested, and that can be used (even if lacking some features) as a controller in the game.

Use this forked repository to store any digital artefacts (including but not limited to
design sketches, photographs, art assets, source code, electronic circuit designs).

\subsection*{C. Cognitive Walkthrough}

You will build your prototype controller over a period of \textbf{4 weeks} utilising a \textbf{fast}, \textbf{iterative} development process.
Each week should see a vast \textbf{improvement} in the quality of design and development working towards a \textbf{shippable product} to demo in the fourth week. that is, a prototype which does not have any major flaws or half-finished features that prevent it from being tested, and that can be used (even if lacking some features) as a controller in the game.

Use this forked repository to store any digital artefacts (including but not limited to
design sketches, photographs, art assets, source code, electronic circuit designs).

\subsection*{D. Synthesize findings }

Bring your prototype controller to the session where it will be subject to heuristic analysis by your peers in class.

For submission, you must also prepare a short \textbf{video demonstration} of your controller.
The maximum length of this video is \textbf{two minutes};
longer videos will be subject to penalties in line with the course word count policy available on LearningSpace.
In your video, briefly demonstrate the functionality of the controller.
You may narrate if you wish, but it is not required.

\textbf{Formative submission:} Participate in the heuristic analysis session.

\subsection*{Summative submission (electronic)}

Create a zip file containing the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item A markdown file named \texttt{readme.md} giving a high-level overview of the project,
    including your concept and background research from part~A.
\item Screenshots of your Trello task board from part~A.
\item All source code and other digital artefacts created for part~B.
    You should include source code files or snippets demonstrating the integration of your controller into the game,
    but you do \textbf{not} need to provide the entire source code for the game.
\item The video demonstration produced for part~C, compressed in AVI or MP4 format.
\end{itemize}

The recommended way to produce this zip file is to check all of the above into your GitHub repository
throughout the course of the project,
and then use the ``Download Zip'' function on the GitHub website.

\textbf{Material not included in the zip file will not be marked},
even if it is available online, and even if tutors have seen it in class.
Please ensure that all material you want the markers to consider is included in your submission.

Upload your zip file to the appropriate submission queue on LearningSpace.

\subsection*{Summative submission (physical)}

Hand in your prototype controller to the Academic Office in Tremough House.
Pack your controller in a suitably sized box, with your student number
and ``BSc Computing for Games -- COMP140 Assignment 1'' written clearly on it.

Your prototype will be returned to you after marking,
however any components that are property of the university (e.g.\ Arduinos \& RaspberryPi boards)
will first be removed.
Thus please do not glue, solder or otherwise permanently affix anything to them.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Falmouth University is nationally and internationally renowned as an arts institution.
Despite the fact that you are studying for a Bachelor of Science degree in a technical discipline,
you are still expected to strive for the same level of \textbf{innovation and creative flair}
as your fellow students in other departments.
All assignments on this course involve a mix of technical and creative activities;
this assignment is more heavily weighted towards the creative than the assignments you have completed thus far.
On this assignment, a competent execution of an unimaginative idea is unlikely to achieve higher than a C grade overall,
as opposed to an imperfect execution of a unique and ambitious concept
--- bear this in mind when working on your design.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generation of ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against the
accepted or most obvious solution

The history of video games is littered with failed peripherals which consumers simply did not want,
which were perceived as expensive gimmicks rather than legitimate enhancements to gameplay.
Your creativity should be balanced by \textbf{commercial awareness}:
your design should be informed by your research into products that have succeeded and failed
in the past, and what underexploited niches exist in the present.
An A$^*$ project would be a highly divergent idea, but one that has clear commercial viability.
Do not be too discouraged if you fall short of this: this is a tall order even for the professionals!

We have given you some of the materials you need: an Arduino and other useful components.
You will need to add your own materials to produce a \textbf{functional} physical prototype.
A ``Blue Peter'' style prototype made from household items is fine,
as is something made out of modelling clay, construction toys etc.
However you should still choose your materials carefully, as overly flimsy construction may
lose you marks on the functionality criterion.

You may also wish to connect electronic components such as LEDs, buzzers, photoresistors etc to the Arduino,
or even use a different, more flexible hardware platform such as RaspberryPi.
However you are discouraged from spending large sums of money on extra hardware,
and doing so is \textbf{not required} to achieve a high mark.
If you choose to go down this route,
it is possible to purchase an RaspberryPi and other useful peripheral online for 
around the price of a textbook (\textsterling 20 -- \textsterling 30).

You should aim to demonstrate a high level of \textbf{sophistication}
in the technical execution of your prototype.
An important part of sophistication is having the insight to choose the right tool for the job:
if a simpler technique fulfils all the requirements, use it.
The use of unnecessarily complicated techniques, serving only to showcase one's own cleverness,
is a dangerous habit for a software developer.

The sole purpose of the \textbf{video demonstration} is to aid moderators and external examiners,
who are not present for the demo session,
in assessing your work.
Your video does \textbf{not} need to be entertaining or highly polished:
a smartphone or webcam video of you or someone else using the controller is sufficient.

%Your \textbf{weekly reports} should document the iterations you make on your design and prototyping.
%The emphasis in this assignment is on creativity and rapid iteration,
%so do not be afraid to ``go back to the drawing board'' if a prototyped idea does not work as well as anticipated.
%However it is important to document (and learn from) your failures, even more so than your successes.
%
%You are strongly encouraged to make use of sketches, diagrams, photographs, screenshots
%and short videos to document your design and prototyping process.
%Many indie game developers use such work-in-progress material as an important tool for promotion
%and community engagement; for example, search Twitter for the hashtag \texttt{\#screenshotsaturday}.
%Videos should ideally be short (5--30 second) demonstrations of functions of your prototype;
%you may narrate if you wish, but it is not required.
