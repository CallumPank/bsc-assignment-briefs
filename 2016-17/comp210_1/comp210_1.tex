\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you are required to choose an existing screen based game interface to evaluate with a focus on usability and user-experience. Although the choice of game interface is down to you, careful consideration must be given to select an interface that is complex and interesting enough to warrant interrogation. How you evaluate the interface is down to you, although your approach must be appropriate and you will need to provide justification in your documentation. To ensure a thorough evaluation it is advised that you implement at least two qualitative and two quantitative methods. Some suggested methods are: cognitive walkthrough, task analysis, user-story mapping, analytic tools or any other methods that you feel are relevant. 

Human-centred design (HCD) puts the end-user at the heart of the design process with a focus on usability and user-experience (UX). It relies on a fast-paced, iterative approach to the design and development process where evaluation and testing are built into every iteration. The majority of methods involve either the intended users themselves or experts in the field. This allows the designer to learn from each iteration and form goals and objectives for the next. It is vital that you familiarise yourself with the various qualitative and quantitive evaluation methods so that you can apply them to all of your future projects.  

This assignment is formed of \textbf{one} part.
The summative submission has \textbf{one} part: a single digital portfolio. 

Begin by forking the GitHub project at the following URL:
\begin{center}
\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp210-interface-evaluation}
\end{center}


\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Implement} a thorough evaluation of a screen based game interface of your choice. write an evaluation document, which must:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{justify} your choice of screen based game interface;
    		\item \textbf{list} and \textbf{justify} your choice of evaluation methods;
		\item \textbf{describe} in great detail, the findings from the evaluation task.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, a ten minute summary of your findings that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} your approach to the task;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the strengths and weaknesses of your chosen interface;
    		\item and \textbf{discuss how} strategies derived from your findings that might improve the usability and user-experience of the interface in question.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Write} a conclusion that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{synthesise} your findings into a clear and concise list of strengths and weaknesses for your chosen interface. 
    		\item \textbf{reflect} on the process and consider the strengths and weaknesses of your approach;
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp210-evaluation}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories. Ensure that you maintain the \texttt{readme.md} file.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 


\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is formed of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Enough progress is made to conduct a meaningful review each week;
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, carry out a thorough evaluation of your chosen interface. Demonstrate your progress to your tutor each week in class. You are expected to implement at least four different methods of evaluation (two qualitative and two quantitative). Ensure that any digital artefacts (including but not limited to sketches, photographs, diagrams, raw data, and any other documentation) are pushed to GitHub prior to each weekly session. 

You will receive immediate \textbf{informal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} and \textbf{peers}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Enough work is available to hold a meaningful discussion; 
	\item Clear evidence of usability testing knowledge and communication skills; 
	\item No breaches of academic integrity. 
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, prepare a ten minute presentation that explains your approach to the task and summarises your findings. Ensure that all related assets are pushed to GitHub and a pull request is made prior to the scheduled viva session. Then, attend the scheduled viva session. 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis. Please refer to the marking rubric at the end of this document for further detail.

To complete Part C, write a conclusion that provides a synthesis  of your findings and reflects on the strengths and weakness of your approach to the task. Then, upload all the documentation to the LearningSpace. Please note, the LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} from your \textbf{tutor} three weeks after the final submission deadline.

\section*{Additional Guidance}
Choosing an appropriate game interface is critical to this task. Your choice of game interface should not only be complex and interesting enough to warrant interrogation but also be relevant to your interests and your aspirations as a game developer. The selection process might involve choosing multiple games and using rapid and heavily discounted evaluation methods to identify the game interface that will produce the most insightful results. Before you begin the task you are encourages to research existing case studies/evaluations to inform your approach. 

Your evaluation must find a balance between expert reviews vs. usability testing. As mentioned previously, human-centred design puts the user at the centre of the design process and thus, relying solely on expert review will not produce results conducive to a HCD process. The purpose of usability testing is to evaluate the users behaviour when interacting with an interface and identify the aspects of the interface that are most regularly a source of frustration and confusion. Tests should be designed around tasks and scenarios that represent typical end-user goals. Participants in your studies must span a range of skills and experiences for your results to be meaningful. It is important that you go beyond your course cohort to find participants. 

Poor planning and poor time management can have a significant impact on this assignment. A comprehensive evaluation cannot be `crammed' into a last minute deluge. Sustain a steady pace across the four weeks. At a minimum, you should aim to implement one method of evaluation a week.

Areas where students tend to lose marks are: depth of insight; analytical skill; and evaluative skill. Depth of insight implies rigorous testing of each task in great. Adequate analysis implies going beyond mere description, perhaps through: researching UI/UX, comparing interface, or even deploying reasoning to generate new insights. Adequate evaluation implies making appropriate reference to evidence and ensuring that evidence is of appropriate quality. Further to this, sound and valid arguments are constructed based on common usability principles.
