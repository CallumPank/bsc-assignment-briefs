In this assignment, you will produce a journal detailing your research on the principles of computing.
In addition to your individual journal, as a group you will create a community wiki to collect and discuss your findings.

Familiarity with the scientific literature is extremely helpful for the computing professional,
both to understand the seminal works that lay the foundations of the field,
and to keep abreast of recent developments at the cutting edge.
Games technology is a fast-moving field, and keeping up is important.
However scientific papers are written in a way that is sometimes daunting to newcomers,
so it is essential to practice the skill of reading and comprehending such papers.
Keeping a research journal is a useful way to record your thoughts
(questions, hypotheses, connections, ideas, ...) as you explore the literature.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Read} at least \textbf{six} papers from the scientific literature on computing.
    \item \textbf{Write} a draft research journal that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{summarise} your thoughts on each paper;
    		\item \textbf{synthesise} what you have read into a cohesive whole.
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write} the final version of your research journal that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Edit} the community wiki to:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=(\roman*)]
    		\item \textbf{share} your findings on what you have read;
    		\item \textbf{debate} your findings with your peers.
    	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Discuss} your research journal with the tutor in the viva session in class.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Setup}

This assignment is an \textbf{academic writing task} and \textbf{wiki task}. Fork the GitHub repository at the following URL:

\indent \url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-journal}

Use the existing directory structure and, as required, extend this structure with sub-directories.

Modify the \texttt{.gitignore} to the defaults for \textbf{TeX}. Please, also ensure that you add editor-specific files and folders to \texttt{.gitignore}. 

\subsection*{Part A}

No separate submission is required for Part~A, however it is a prerequisite for completing the other parts.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B consists of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part B, write your research journal.
It is recommended that you write your journal entry in the \texttt{readme.md} file within your forked repository,
but you may use LaTeX if you prefer.
Commit your work to your GitHub repository to be signed off during personal tutor meetings,
at least once every three weeks during semester~1.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis
using the criteria listed in the marking rubric at the end of this document.

To complete Part C, revise your report from Part~B to take into account any feedback you have received so far.

Compress your \texttt{readme.md} file, along with any required images or other external files,
into a \texttt{.zip} file and upload it to LearningSpace.
Alternatively, if you have used LaTeX, upload a \texttt{.pdf} file of your journal to LearningSpace.
Note that LearningSpace will only accept a single \texttt{.zip} or \texttt{.pdf} file.

You will receive \textbf{formal feedback} three weeks after the final deadline.

\subsection*{Part D}

Part D consists of \textbf{multiple formative submissions}. This work is \textbf{individual}, but with a \textbf{group-based} component, and will be assessed on a \textbf{criterion-referenced} basis.
The criterion used to assess this part relates to the quantity and quality of your contributions.

To complete Part D, contribute to the wiki at the following URL:

\url{https://github.com/Falmouth-Games-Academy/comp110-journal/wiki}

Please ensure that you are editing the wiki for the \texttt{Falmouth-Games-Academy} repository,
and \textbf{not} the wiki for your fork of the repository.
The nature of your contribution to the wiki is up to you, and students are expected to direct themselves and their peers
in making the wiki a useful and academically sound resource for themselves.

During your personal tutor meetings, make your tutor aware of your contributions to the wiki.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback} as well as \textbf{ongoing peer feedback}.

\subsection*{Part E}

Part E consists of a \textbf{single formative submission}. This work is \textbf{individual} and will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis.

To complete Part E, bring the final version of your research journal to the viva session in class.
Be ready to discuss your work with your tutor.

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal feedback}.

\section*{Additional Guidance}

One paper will be suggested in class every two weeks; this is the bare minimum that you should read.
You should also follow up some of the prior work referenced in these papers,
as well as subsequent work that references them.
As much as possible you should focus your reading on peer-reviewed scholarly sources reporting primary research:
articles in scientific workshops, conferences, journals, and some books or book chapters.
Other sources tend to be less rigorous, and should be used only for background information
or in cases where their use can be convincingly justified.

A common pitfall is to focus too much on summarising the content of the papers you have read.
For higher marks you need to demonstrate \textbf{insight} into what you have read:
forming inferences and analyses beyond what is written in the paper.
A related pitfall is to structure the journal simply as a disconnected sequence of paper summaries.
Instead aim to \textbf{synthesise} multiple papers into a cohesive whole,
drawing connections between works by different authors.

How you structure your research journal is up to you:
ultimately it is a tool for you to document your research in whatever way is most helpful for you.
However you may wish to start by summarising the content of the paper, and then considering some of the following questions:
What does the paper contribute to the field of computing?
Why is it significant and/or influential?
Why did the researchers choose the approach that they did?
Is there anything that you did not understand?
Is there anything counterintuitive or surprising in the paper?
Do you disagree with any of the assumptions or claims it makes?
Does the paper suggest any further research questions?
How does the paper support or contradict other papers you have read?
You do not necessarily need to address all of these questions for every paper you read,
nor is this an exhaustive list.
