\section*{Introduction}

In this assignment, you will design and implement a 2D game for Windows PC. Your game will be written in Python using the PyGame library. You will work in small groups (typically, 3--4 students).

Computing for Games encompasses a broad range of technical, creative, communicative, and commercial skills. All of your assignments involve a mixture of these; but, this assignment emphasises a rich combination that reflects industry practice.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Write}, as an \textbf{individual}, a 2-page handout that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outline} a game concept;
    		\item \textbf{state} a target market;
    		\item \textbf{describe} at least \textbf{one} core game mechanic;
    		\item and then \textbf{explain how} the game concept relates to the constraints.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as an \textbf{individual}, a 3-minute `elevator pitch', which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the game concept contained in your handout;
    		\item and \textbf{illustrate why} someone should invest in your game concept.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare}, as a \textbf{group}, a plan, which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	    	\item \textbf{identify} the skills and time available to complete pre-production;
    	    	\item \textbf{iterate} upon \textbf{and improve} the game design;
    		\item \textbf{describe} the key user stories that comprise the game design;
    		\item and \textbf{highlight} the stories that will comprise a minimal viable product.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, an initial pre-production prototype of the game in PyGame which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{illustrate} the core game mechanic.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Implement}, as a \textbf{group}, a final pre-production prototype of the game in PyGame which will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{revise} any issues raised by your tutor and/or your peers.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Write}, as a \textbf{group}, a presentation slide-deck and 2-page handout that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{outline} the game design;
    		\item and \textbf{explain} the game design's commercial feasibility.
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Present}, as a \textbf{group}, a 10-minute `investment pitch` that will:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{clarify} the game design contained in your presentation slide-deck and handout;
    		\item and \textbf{demonstrate} the final pre-production prototype of the game.
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Additional Guidance}

Avoid poor planning and time management. By now this will be a familiar phrase, but it is no less true.
In particular, avoid underestimating the effort required to implement even a simple game; always consider scope.
From the pitch stage, you should consider very carefully what is feasible.

For the most part, your work will be marked as a group effort.
However we want to avoid the situation where students try to ``coast'' through the assignment
on their fellow group members' work,
and equally the situation where one member of the group takes the lion's share of the work
and prevents the others from contributing effectively.
Marks will be weighted by a multiplier for \textbf{individual contribution},
which aims to penalise both of these behaviours.
We assess this by several means, including but not limited to: sprint reviews; individual vivas; feedback from your peers;
attribution in the source code; and GitHub commit logs.
Any student who has contributed their \textit{fair share} of effort to the project will receive a fair \% for their effort,
so any student who is putting in the appropriate level of effort has no need to worry.
Note that effort is not the same as productivity.

The first step in planning your implementation should be to break your concept down into \textbf{user stories}. 
Your user stories should be \textbf{distinguishable} (i.e.\ there should be little overlap between them)
and \textbf{easily measured} (i.e.\ it should be easy to tell when each user story has been implemented).
They should also be \textbf{comprehensive}, i.e.\ the user stories should completely capture the
desired functionality of the game, with no gaps.
Imagine giving your user stories to a developer who has never seen a game of your target genre.
Would they be able to implement the game correctly, or would they miss key features?

%Wherever possible, you should clearly \textbf{attribute} the author(s) of segments of your code.
%The easiest way to do this is by inserting appropriate comments, for example:
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was written by student 1511111 */
%\end{lstlisting}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was pair-programmed by students 1522222 and 1533333 */
%\end{lstlisting}
%\begin{lstlisting}
%/* This function was adapted by student 1544444 from an example at http://stackoverflow.com/a/1657490 */
%\end{lstlisting}

Your code will be assessed on \textbf{functional coherence}:
how well the finished game corresponds to the user stories,
and whether the game has any obvious bugs.
Correspondence to user stories runs both ways:
implementing features that were not present in the design (``feature creep'')
is just as bad as neglecting to implement features.

Your code will also be assessed on \textbf{sophistication}.
To succeed on a project of this size and complexity,
you will need to make use of appropriate algorithms, data structures, libraries, and object oriented programming concepts.
Appropriateness to the task at hand is key:
you will \textbf{not} receive credit for complexity  
where something simpler would have sufficed.

\textbf{Maintainability} is important in all programming projects,
but doubly so when working in a team.
Use \textbf{comments} liberally to improve code comprehension,
and carefully choose the \textbf{names} for your files, classes, functions and variables.
Use a well-established commenting convention
for \textbf{high-level documentation}.
The open-source tool Doxygen supports several such conventions.
Also ensure that all code corresponds to a sensible and consistent \textbf{formatting style}:
indentation, whitespace, placement of curly braces, etc.
Hard-coded \textbf{literals} (numbers and strings) within the source should be avoided,
with values instead defined as constants together in a single place.
Consider allowing some literal values, where appropriate, to be ``tinkered'' without changing the source code,
e.g.\ by defining them in an external file read by the game on startup.

As with all assignments on this course, you are expected to display a level of
\textbf{innovation and creative flair} befitting Falmouth University's reputation as a world-leading
arts institution.
We are looking for creativity in the design of your \textbf{game mechanics};
you will \textbf{not} be judged on the quality of your art assets.
One approach to promoting creativity is
\textbf{divergent thinking}: generating ideas by exploring many possible solutions.
Often the most interesting ideas are \textbf{subversive}: they deliberately go against
convention or obvious solutions.
